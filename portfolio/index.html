                    I developed a responsive website from scratch, hosted on Firebase. It incorporates a real-time database and a Telegram bot for CRUD operations on site information, such as special equipment and services. React and SCSS were used for implementation and styling.

                                The store was built from scratch on React using Firebase technologies. Implemented: an administrative panel for managing site content and editing the existing one, an order system, a user account with email confirmation. The site is fully responsive and uses its own Hook to interact with Firebase, as well as Context to transfer content between components.
